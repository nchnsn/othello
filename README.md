# othello
Writing a version of the popular board game Othello (aka [reversi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi)) from scratch. The goal of this project is:
1. To work on architecting an application with multiple components and better understanding Model, View, Controller.
2. To think about my Javscript components in a way where I am being efficient, not creating global variables, reusing as many components as possible, and building scalable JS, HTML that I don't have to rewrite everytime I change something about the game.
3. Provide me with a tangeble starting point that I can use to refactor as I introduce new concepts, frameworks, into my skillset.

*Step 1* 
Get Othello working no matter what means possible. Focus on ES5 and vanilla javascript if possible. 

*Step 2*
Refactor game so that you are not using global variables, you are not copying pasting any code chunks, and think about scalability and memory management.

*Step 3*
Refactor code again to use Jquery and ES6.

*Step 4*
Refactor Code and write game in React.
